# Bzip2

An Elixir binding to [libbzip2](https://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/index.html) - a lossless compression library.

This package is being developed as a learning exercise in using and writing idiomatic Elixir. The eventual aim is to convert this package into a pure Elixir implementation.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bzip2` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bzip2, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/bzip2](https://hexdocs.pm/bzip2).
